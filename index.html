        <h1 id="header">Oh Where Oh Where Shall I 24</h1>
        <h2 class="subHeader">Where mushers spend their critical 24-hour rest during the Iditarod.</h2>

        


        <img class="mediumImg" src="blank1.png">

        <div class="mid card"><p>The 24-hour rest is the most obvious strategic move of the 1,000-mile race. Mushers want to time the rest—far longer than any other rest periods in the race—so that their dogs can best benefit from the uninterrupted cycle of feeding, napping, muscle massages, and foot care. And the strong checkpoint hospitality and management history in Takotna (and the record of winning mushers taking rest there) factors into the decision as well. But mushers seeking atonement in a 24 may be asking for too much. As Jeff King said in 2016, <i>"you don’t absolve sins [committed] before the 24 hour break, by taking a 24 hour break."</i> </p></div>

<img class="mediumImg" src="testCirc9_label.png">

 <div class="mid card"><p>
The last time the southern route was completed was run in 2013 (the 2015 and 2017 races were moved to Fairbanks due to bad snow conditions) the Iditarod saw the emergence of a new strategy. 2013 saw Martin Buser pull off what—if successful— would have been regarded as one final move of mushing genius by running his team almost nonstop from the start in Willow to Rohn - nearly 200 miles with only short breaks. <br /><br />He then declared his 24-hour rest executing the key move in a race plan aimed at tapping into sled dogs' immense and unknown physiological capacity. After the rest, his team raced to the front of the pack and had a hours on his chasers when the teams had banked their 24 hour breaks hundreds of miles down the trail. But the Buser team slowed significantly as the race pushed through Iditarod he finished in 17th. The strategy may not be done though. Buser tried a variation in 2014 and earned his best finish in six years.</p></div>
